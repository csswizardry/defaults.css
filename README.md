# `defaults.css`

_A thoroughly modern, light-touch CSS reset for people who like writing CSS._

![](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/assets/img/baseline-wordmark.png)

`defaults.css` is a Baseline-compatible CSS reset/normalise that weighs less
than a kilobyte. It removes the bulk of unwanted browser defaults as well as
smoothing out some inconsistencies. It’s part reset, part normalise.

```bash
$ npm i @csswizardry/defaults.css
```

## 🧩 Patterns and Paradigms

`defaults.css` is light-touch by default. It doesn’t really do _much_; certainly
nothing that you wouldn’t want it to do.

Most projects end up with a version of Normalize.css and a reset on top of that.
This means that most elements have been styled at least three times before you
even start work. Instead of normalising and then resetting, `defaults.css` is
designed to do both at once.

As someone who spends a lot of time reading code, it’s incredibly frustrating to
see every element has passed through a million different rulesets and DevTools
just becomes noise. To that end, `defaults.css` does as little as it can get
away with.

It even goes as far as gating rules behind the relevant `@-rule` where possible,
e.g.:

```css
@supports (-webkit-text-size-adjust: none) {

  html {
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
  }

}
```

There’s no point seeing `-webkit-text-size-adjust` in Firefox’s DevTools.

## ⚙️ Configuration

In a couple of locations, you can pass in your own configuration to customise
`defaults.css` to your own needs. The three areas of customisation as of 0.1.0
are:

* **Vertical rhythm:** Set a baseline grid on typographical elements by
  defining `--defaults-margin-bottom` in your project, e.g.:
  ```css
  :root {
    --defaults-margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  }
  ```
* **Shape margins:** If you want floated images to have a specific margin that
  hugs their shape, define your own `--defaults-shape-margin`.
* **Scroll margin:** If you want `:target`ed elements to sit a small distance
  from the edge of the viewport, define `--defaults-scroll-margin` in your own
  project.

It’s worth noting that **if you don’t configure any of these settings,
`defaults.css` does nothing at all**: it will never make opinionated decisions
without your permission.

### 🥞 Cascade Layers

`defaults.css` uses CSS’ [Cascade
Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers)
to isolate and restrict its reach. If you don’t use Cascade Layers in your own
project, that’s perfect—you don’t need to do anything at all and your own CSS
will always, automatically, take precedence, no matter where `defaults.css` is
included.

If you are using Cascade Layers, `defaults.css` is wrapped in `@layer defaults
{ … }`. You’ll need to add `defaults` to your own `@layer` declaration to ensure
`defaults.css` is applied in the correct order, e.g.:

```css
@layer defaults, elements, components, utilities;
       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

## 🤝 Contributions

v0.1.0 had the sole criteria of being able to replace my combined
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [inuitcss
reset](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/blob/develop/generic/_generic.reset.scss).
Now that it is published and public, I would gratefully accept feedback and
contributions.

## 🙏 Credits

It goes without saying,
[Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) redefined the genre.
Now that cross-browser inconsistencies are far fewer, our lives are a lot
easier.
